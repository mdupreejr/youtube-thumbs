# YouTube Thumbs - Home Assistant Add-on

A Home Assistant add-on that lets you rate YouTube videos (üëç/üëé) for songs playing on your AppleTV. Perfect for Lutron remote integration or any automation that needs to rate music.

## Features

- üéµ Rate currently playing songs via REST API
- üîç Automatic YouTube video matching with fuzzy search
- üõ°Ô∏è Built-in rate limiting (configurable)
- üìù Comprehensive logging integrated with Home Assistant
- üìä Detailed user action audit trail
- ‚ö° Optimized performance with caching and connection pooling

## Installation **[REVIEW: Let's just have the installation instructions in one place, not in Readme, DOcs and Install md's]**

**Quick Install:**

1. Add this repository URL in Home Assistant Add-on Store
2. Install the "YouTube Thumbs Rating" add-on
3. Copy your OAuth credentials to the addon_configs directory
4. Configure the add-on with your HA token and media player entity
5. Start the add-on

**For detailed instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)**

## Setup YouTube OAuth

Before using this add-on, you need YouTube OAuth credentials:

1. Create a project in [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Enable **YouTube Data API v3**
3. Create **OAuth 2.0 Desktop** credentials
4. Download `credentials.json`
5. Run the OAuth flow once to generate `token.pickle`
6. Copy both files to `/addon_configs/XXXXXXXX_youtube_thumbs/`

See [DOCS.md](DOCS.md) for detailed OAuth setup instructions.

## Configuration

Add REST commands to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
rest_command:
  youtube_thumbs_up:
    url: "http://localhost:21812/thumbs_up"
    method: POST
    timeout: 30

  youtube_thumbs_down:
    url: "http://localhost:21812/thumbs_down"
    method: POST
    timeout: 30
```

Then create automations to call these services. Example for Lutron remote:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Thumbs Up Button"
    trigger:
      - platform: device
        device_id: your_device_id
        type: press
        subtype: button_1
    action:
      - service: rest_command.youtube_thumbs_up
```

## API Endpoints

### `POST /thumbs_up` / `POST /thumbs_down`
Rate the currently playing song.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully rated like",
  "video_id": "zmLIxKpgEPw",
  "title": "Song Title"
}
```

### `GET /health`
Health check with rate limiter stats.

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "rate_limiter": {
    "last_minute": 2,
    "last_hour": 15,
    "last_day": 47,
    "limits": { ... }
  }
}
```

## How It Works

1. Service fetches current media from Home Assistant
2. Searches YouTube for matching video (by title, artist, duration ¬±2s)
3. Filters results using fuzzy title matching (50%+ word overlap)
4. Rates the best match on YouTube

## Add-on Configuration Options

Configure these in the add-on Configuration tab:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `home_assistant_token` | (required) | Your HA Long-Lived Access Token |
| `media_player_entity` | (required) | Media player entity ID |
| `home_assistant_url` | http://supervisor/core | HA URL (use default for add-ons) |
| `port` | 21812 | Service port |
| `rate_limit_per_minute` | 10 | Max requests/minute |
| `rate_limit_per_hour` | 100 | Max requests/hour |
| `rate_limit_per_day` | 500 | Max requests/day |
| `log_level` | INFO | Logging level |

## Troubleshooting

**"No media currently playing"**
- Verify AppleTV is playing music
- Check media player entity ID is correct in add-on configuration

**"Video not found"**
- Ensure YouTube account is signed in on AppleTV
- Song must appear in your YouTube watch history
- Check duration matching (¬±2 seconds tolerance)

**OAuth/Credentials errors**
- Verify `credentials.json` and `token.pickle` are in `/addon_configs/XXXXXXXX_youtube_thumbs/`
- Check add-on logs for specific error messages
- Ensure OAuth credentials are from Google Cloud Console with YouTube Data API v3 enabled

**Check Logs**
- View in Home Assistant: Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí YouTube Thumbs Rating ‚Üí Log tab
- Set `log_level: DEBUG` in configuration for detailed output

## Logging

The add-on integrates with Home Assistant's logging system:

**Log Levels:**
- **INFO**: General application flow and successful operations
- **WARNING**: Rate limiting, multiple matches, non-critical issues
- **ERROR**: Failed operations with context
- **DEBUG**: Detailed tracebacks and debugging (set `log_level: DEBUG` in config)

**User Action Logging:**
User actions are logged with `[USER_ACTION]` prefix:
```
[USER_ACTION] LIKE | "Song Title" by Artist | ID: xyz123 | SUCCESS
[USER_ACTION] DISLIKE | "Another Song" | ID: abc456 | FAILED - Video not found
```

View logs in the add-on **Log** tab.

## Security

- OAuth credentials stored in `/addon_configs/` (persistent storage)
- Home Assistant token encrypted by Supervisor
- Service only accessible from localhost (not exposed to network)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share your `credentials.json`, `token.pickle`, or HA token
